197 somewhat know answer question already always feel though need pick topic basic understanding generally speaking single index includes fields might querying sorting given time isnt likely useful yet seen type thing someone thought well put stuff index database use find needs without ever seen execution plan actual queries run imagine table like id int pk uid name varchar50 customerid int foreign key datecreated datetime might see single index including name customerid datecreated fields understanding index would used query like example select id name customerid datecreated representatives customerid order datecreated query seems better idea would index including customerid datecreated fields customerid field first would create index would data organized way query could quickly find needs order needs another thing see perhaps frequently first individual indexes field one name customerid datecreated fields unlike first example type arrangement seems sometimes least partially useful querys execution plan may show least using index customerid select records using index datecreated field sort know broad question specific answer particular query particular set tables usually see execution plan says going otherwise take specifics tables queries account also know depends often query might run opposed overhead maintaining particular index suppose im asking general starting point indexes idea specific indexes specific frequently pulled queries fields order clauses make sense

2701 lnnvl oracle built function returns true conditions evaluating false unknown returns false conditions evaluating true question would benefit returning opposite truth condition rather handling null values example suppose emp table startcommission currentcommission columns may contain nulls following returns rows neither value null select emp startcommission currentcommission wanted include rows either commission null could something like select emp startcommission currentcommission startcommission null currentcommission null would seem like function would exist shorten syntax using lnnvl returns non equal records records nulls select emp lnnvlstartcommission currentcommission adding returns rows without nulls seems desired functionality case would keep true conditions true false conditions false unknown conditions evaluate true really created low use case really likely want turn unknown true true false false true create table emp startcommission number32 currentcommission number32 insert emp values nullnull insert emp values null insert emp values 2null insert emp values

42998 conceptual question individual queries faster joins try squeeze every info want client side one select statement use many seems convenient tl dr joined query takes longer running individual queries fault expected first database savvy may noticed get information multiple tables often faster get information via multiple queries individual tables maybe containing simple inner join patch data together client side try write complex joined query get data one query tried put one extremely simple example together sql fiddle schema setup create table master id int null name varchar242 char null constraint pk master primary key id create table data id int null master id int null value number constraint pk data primary key id constraint fk data master foreign key master id references master id insert master values one insert master values two insert master values three create sequence seq data id insert data values seq data id nextval insert data values seq data id nextval insert data values seq data id nextval insert data values seq data id nextval insert data values seq data id nextval insert data values seq data id nextval query select name master id results name one query select id value data master id results id value query select name id value master inner join data id master id id results name id value one one one course didnt measure performance one may observe query returns amount usable information query return 2x3 data cells client return 3x3 data cells client join naturally include redundancy result set generalizing far fetched joined query always return data individual queries receive amount information since database cobble together data large datasets one assume database work single joined query individual ones since least return data client would follow observe splitting client side query multiple queries yield better performance way go would rather mean messed joined query

116615 want merge one table another need apply conditional logic matched clause would ideally done like merge atable using btable id id matched insert matched needsadjustment update set col1 col1 adjustment col2 col2 adjustment col3 col3 adjustment matched default case needsadjustment update set col1 col1 col2 col2 col3 col3 valid sql according msdn documenation two matched clauses one must specify update action one must specify delete action leads following query merge atable using btable id id matched insert happens matched update set col1 case needsadjustment col1 else col1 adjustment end col2 case needsadjustment col2 else col2 adjustment end col3 case needsadjustment col3 else col3 adjustment end conditional logic moved inside update get around fact merges one matched update clause instead one check per row one check per row per column many columns three example avoid repeating condition every column needs updated better way conditional updates perhaps dont involve merges

table updating rows order object id effectively takes exclusive row locks records order held remainder transaction believe happens even without holdlock hint update statements concurrent transactions block waiting transaction commit updated rows others obtain locks required update rows row locks taken ascending order locks set acquired guarantees transaction holds exclusive locks well established fact locking order matters unlocking order ask linus https yarchive net comp linux lock ordering html first question update statements work intended question multiple parts predicate identify rows update predicate hold true time exclusive row lock held rows updated correct lock hints since weve established transaction holds locks current one holds logically follows transaction would attempting update lock records object ids personal inventory table point think need force database engine use row level locks updating personal inventory rows well reason escalates page lock could inadvertently lock records happen page dont belong set object ids transaction working example suppose concurrent transaction locks global record seems totally unrelated first transaction working records objects none global personal inventory records overlap lock contention personal inventory records working either however concurrent transaction takes page level locks personal inventory table pages happen contain records object transaction could inadvertently hold page locks records belonging likewise first transaction may also hold page level locks contain records neither transaction proceed one locked pages waiting words page level locks destroy established locking order locking unrelated records arbitrary order updating records personal inventory table bit complex update multiple rows update statements still run one object id time joined temporary table establishes set user ids update pi rowlock xlock holdlock set count count quantitytoreserve personalinventory pi inner join

result satisfying predicate critical correct functioning system case id like know id like know expected locks arent held locks held please assume disabled lock escalation table notes concerned whether forcing row level locks even possible discovered theres table option disable lock escalation im concerned correctness performance using database row locks going many orders magnitude faster locking solution involves multiple round trips server using sp getapplock also work would redundantly perform function locks global inventory table achieve simultaneously nothing prevent page lock creep mentioned using database row level locks multiple concurrent transactions complete quickly simultaneously minimal lock contention result atomic high throughput inventory reservations without worry managing transactions application level ultimately would complex less reliable page locks would acceptable way force one part composite key reside different data pages dont think thats possible example keyed personal table objectid userid id ensure page contains records single object id many users

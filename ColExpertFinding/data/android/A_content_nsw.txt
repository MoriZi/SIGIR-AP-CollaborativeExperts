176532 two factors going one practical historical practical reason use mixed architectures phones power consumption critical phones phones spend lot time modes require little performance makes sense cores optimized minimal power consumption little performance needed cores optimized provide maximum performance needed reason largely historical desktop cpus single cores improving desktop cpu performance consisted almost exclusively making core execute many instructions per second possible even today much desktop software take full advantage multiple cores many would prefer cpu cores core cpu cores slower getting much performance single core possible requires huge amounts cpu real estate real estate could otherwise used provide cores intels newest kaby lake cpus max cores people buy core faster predecessors cores many upgrade even cpus higher core count time expect see much desktop software fully optimized support cores happens engineering tradeoffs start favor cores faster cores desktops cores almost certainly still get faster youll start see people preferring core cpu core cpu even core slower chip designers follow market

put classical intuitions scrap actually think could make perfect sense even non physicist given postulates tried looking back learning qm little success since undergrad students often precisely bombarded poorly justified postulates stop questioning points dont want get started mathematical definitions nothing like quantum systems infinite dimensional hilbert space doesnt mean anything relatives includes pretty much actual postulates qm want explanation intuitive id like avoid mumbo jumbo related wave particle duality think know im one explanations regarding inacurrate actually inefficient giving good description quantum behaviour since non physicists arent familiar properties classical wave anyway mostly used talking position quantum particle ive never heard someone say spin behaves like wave like particle im looking something fundamental universal said think important include discussion relative phase two superpositioned states leads quantum interference perhaps wave like feature applies throughout qm quantum superposition quantum computing would pretty much useless even perform one billion calculations simultaneously measuring system would get single random value goal manipulate system create destructive interference unwanted results order increase probability measuring desired value requires notion quantum phase uncertainty principle might toughest challenge since get basic idea without invoking qm first even classical mechanics impossible measure something arbitrarily big precision simply instrumental limitations second makes sense get different results measure position momentum xp neq since interact system making first observation leaving different state afterward could explain fundamental implications qm wasnt sure entanglement quantization weirdness entanglement doesnt come achieve interpret still unresolved issue far know many world copenhagen interpretation etc quantization particle properties doesnt seem like intrinsic feature qm consequence boundary conditions free electron vaccum continuous energy spectrum put potential well states forbidden exactly forbidden course even bohr explained hydrogen atom semi classical model using destructive interference state electron also quantization matter photons electrons quarks etc another story think people familiar idea matter made atoms isnt far stretch include light well point two principles dont appear quite essential ones understand qm havent found satisfying answer similar posts forum instance since im interested overall description qm wavefunctions superposition dont want get motivations behind theory also id like give accurate meaningful answer one leads directly pseudoscientific interpretations qm particles waves vice versa everything forbidden mandatory consciousness affects reality kind thing edit clarify question perhaps would say concerning special relativity sr basic assumption sr everyone always sees light traveling speed matter circumstances far good imagine im train going km throw ball front km perspective ball going km standing ground ball going km respect makes perfect sense since consider velocity train good lets replace ball photon oh oh according previous assumption see photon travelling speed even though moving km add speed measurement earlier implies perceive time space differently boom get pretty much sr course one also mention maximum speed simple assumption implies core theory would equivalent qm little assumption accepted implies theory emilio pisanty saw post comment one links end mine said im interested need qm want know explain fundamental assumption necessary build theory however true questions linked ways guess edit im interested need qm pretty obvious well turn theory best describes world want explain qm basically weird main features qm lot weirdness simply describe phenomena one one doesnt reflect essence theory whole looks like patchwork theory everyone added magical part know qm postulates convention qm mathematical formalism well use hermitian matrix observables well use wavefunction complex hilbert space represent particle rather description qm happens quantum world phenomena correctly predicts matter counterintuitive classical minds edit thank contributions havent chosen answer yet im curious see someone else give try theres little point want stress many answers give good description weird concepts qm goal wrap much possible give explanation connected little assumptions possible far knzhous answer closest im looking im entirely satisfied even though theres probably answer good enough answers close wave particle duality im fan people understand electrons particles week days waves weekend however perhaps unavoidable truly include phenomena listed thought perhaps talking quantum fields rather waves matter discussion would less likely lead misinterpretation also said well qm incomprehensible lay people think thats giving easily feels little dishonest qm secret society special elite think important researchers explain goal intend achieve general public think 2nd question physicists asked often tax money pay work really think answer well couldnt understand trust satisfying qm counterintuitive well explained make sense im looking easiest way make people realize without simply saying well forget anything know also think theory would much easier accept people often exposed ideas children high school students learn world made atoms accept even though see atoms couldnt qm part common scientific culture true may sound ridiculous first hear superposition indeterminate states isnt giving saying well need degree understand going change make appreciable
